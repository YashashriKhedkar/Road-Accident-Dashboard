# Road-Accident-Dashboard-Description

## Problem Statement :
This dashboard visualizes key data on road accidents to help identify patterns and risk factors associated with road casualties. By examining accident trends by vehicle type, road type, location, and environmental factors, this dashboard supports decision-making for improving road safety measures.

## Data Overview :
### The dashboard provides comprehensive statistics on road accidents, with a focus on:
1. Total Casualties: 417,883
2. Fatal Casualties: 7,135 (1.7%)
3. Serious Casualties: 59,312 (14.2%)
4. Slight Casualties: 351,436 (84.1%)
5. Casualties by Cars: 333,485 (79.8% of total)

## Key Visualizations :
1. KPI Metrics: Summary metrics display overall casualty counts and percentage breakdowns of fatal, serious, and slight casualties.
2. Total Casualties by Vehicle Type: A sidebar graphic shows total casualties by vehicle type, with cars accounting for the largest portion (333,485), followed by trucks (33,472), bicycles (33,672), and buses (12,798).
3. CY vs. PY Casualties Monthly Trend: A line graph compares casualties in the current year (CY) to the previous year (PY) across each month, allowing for month-to-month trend analysis.
4. Casualties by Road Type: A horizontal bar chart categorizes casualties by road type. Single carriageways have the highest casualty count (309.7K), followed by dual carriageways (67.4K), roundabouts (26.8K), and other road types.
5. Casualties by Road Surface: A stacked bar graph indicates casualties by road surface condition, with the majority occurring on dry surfaces (279,445), followed by wet surfaces (115,261), and snow/ice.
6. Casualties by Location/Area: A donut chart distinguishes casualties by area type, showing higher casualties in urban areas (255.9K) compared to rural areas (162.0K).
7. Casualties by Light Condition: Another donut chart segments casualties based on lighting conditions, with a majority happening during daylight (305.0K) compared to dark conditions (112.9K).
   
## Interactive Filter Panel :
1. Accident Date: A time-based filter enables users to view data for specific years or time ranges.
2. Location Filter: Users can filter the data to view casualties specifically in Rural or Urban areas.

## Key Insights :
1. High-Risk Road Types: Single carriageways have the highest casualty count, suggesting they may be a key area for safety improvements.
2. Vehicle Involvement: Cars are involved in nearly 80% of all casualties, making them the primary focus for road safety strategies.
Environmental Conditions: The majority of casualties occur on dry road surfaces and in daylight, suggesting that factors other than visibility or weather are contributing to accidents.
3. Urban vs. Rural: Urban areas have significantly higher casualty numbers than rural areas, potentially due to higher traffic density.

## Conclusion :
The Road Accident Dashboard provides valuable insights for road safety professionals by highlighting high-risk areas, vehicle types, and environmental conditions associated with accidents. These insights can inform targeted interventions, such as improved road infrastructure, enhanced traffic regulations for urban areas, and safety campaigns focused on reducing car-related accidents.
